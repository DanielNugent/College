# Java socket programming application (OpenFlow)
The general premise of the software is an implementation of OpenFlow. The main focus being the implementation of flow tables in the routers and the message types that support the configuration of switches through a controller.
OpenFlow is a type of communication protocol, which uses routers in a network to efficiently (low-latency) forward packets to the desired location. For our purpose, we pre-programmed the routes between different end users, but as an extension we could have implemented Link State routing or Distance vector routing and perhaps used an algorithm such as Dijkstraâ€™s shortest distance. Differently companies and manufacturers may have their own proprietary software implementation over their network to satisfy their own needs. The first OpenFlow version was released in 2011 and there have been constant improvements and upgrades to it over the years. 
The three components that we had to implement were the Controller, the End User and the routers (or switches) which are responsible for forwarding incoming packets.
